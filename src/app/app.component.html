      I'm a self taught front end and hybrid (Ionic) mobile developer. I am the sole front end developer for <a href="http://www.ribitt.io" target="_blank">Ribitt</a> in Toronto, Ontario.
      I created and maintain 1 website and multiple android and ios apps for both phone and tablet.
      I love learning on the fly and challenges that push me to get out of my comfort zone. I have a passion for creation so lets start building together!

      The flagship product at <a href="http://www.ribitt.io" class="ribittTitle">Ribitt</a>. I created the entire front end of this app from beginning to end in a couple months, with many iterations and updates over a span of over 2 and a half years.
      Ribitt is an app that allows users to make purchases at local businesses and earn loyalty points on every transaction. The transaction works in tandem with the Ribitt Bussiness App,
      which I also created the entire front end for.

      This product is used by participating merchants on the Ribitt platform. This app allows merchants to connect to users by having users scan a QR code or NFC sticker.
      Merchants are then able to enter the transaction amount through the app and send it to the user for approval and processing. I created the entire front end for this app.
      Firebase is used for real time connection between user and merchants and stripe is used for payment processing.

      The Ribitt Business Web App has the same functionality as the Ribitt Business Merchant App. Some merchants have computers at their checkout terminal and preferred to use
      that to process transactions, instead of the mobile app. It was created using Angular 2 and deployed using Heroku.

      The Community Manager at Ribitt needed an easy way to check recent transactions businesses on the platform without having to check reports.
      I was given free reign to create a basic user friendly app with this functionality. I decided to test out the new Ionic 4 update at the time and use it to make this app. I worked with the Ribitt backend developer to create this app.

      The Happy Box team found that there are no adequate products on the market that could
      properly track inventory and boxes created for this unique style of ecommerce business. So in less that 72 hours i created The Happy Box Inventory App,
      from design and database to completed product. Another week was used to refine and add other features that the team required. PouchDb and IBM's Cloudant were used for the database.
